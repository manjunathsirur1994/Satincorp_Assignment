There are two csv files that represent student response data for the years 2021 and 2022. The columns of the csv files are:

student_id
question_id
ability - The ability skill of the student.
difficulty - The difficulty of the question.
answered_correctly - Whether the student answered the question correctly or not
Analyse the csv files to answer the following questions:



How did the student's ability to answer the questions change ?
Did the questions get difficult or easy?
Can you create a model that can predict if a student will answer a question correctly?
Note down any other observations you may have about the data.
